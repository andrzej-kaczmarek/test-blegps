# some hacking here... baselibc does not have timegm() so it is
# linked from toolchain. this causes also other symbols to be
# imported, in particular strtol() which duplicated symbol from
# baselibc. since timegm() is only used by minmea and we don't
# need this particular API, let's just redefine symbol in a way
# that it compiles and links properly.
